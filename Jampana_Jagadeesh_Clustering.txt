1. Optimal Number of Clusters:
	The optimal number of clusters determined was 2.

2. Davies-Bouldin Index:
	DB Index = 0.9588.
	Lower values of the DB Index indicate better clustering quality.

3. Cluster Characteristics:
	Cluster 0:
	Customers with high transaction frequencies and total transaction values.
	More representation from North America and Europe regions.
	Cluster 1:
	Customers with lower transaction frequencies and total values.
	Dominant representation from Asia and South America.

4. Visualization:
	Visualized clusters using:
	2D scatter plots (based on PCA components).
	Bar plots for region-wise customer distribution.
	Box plots for transaction value distributions.
